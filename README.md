# React Native Push Notifications - WhatsApp Style

A React Native application demonstrating advanced push notification capabilities with WhatsApp-like call notifications. This project showcases notification handling across all app states with Android 15 compatibility.

## üöÄ Features

- **WhatsApp-like Call Notifications**: Full-screen call interface with accept/decline actions
- **Multi-State Support**: Works in foreground, background, and killed app states
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging**: Real-time push notification delivery
- **Native Android Modules**: Custom Kotlin modules for advanced notification handling
- **Deep Linking**: Navigate to specific screens from notifications

## üìã Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (18+)
- **React Native CLI**
- **Android Studio** with Android SDK
- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 11 or higher
- **Firebase Account** for FCM setup

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Step 1: Clone and Install Dependencies

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd PushNotification
npm install
```

### Step 2: Firebase Configuration

1. **Create Firebase Project**:
   - Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
   - Create a new project named `PushNotificationApp`
   - Enable Google Analytics (optional)

2. **Add Android App**:
   - Click "Add app" ‚Üí Android
   - Package name: `com.pushnotification`
   - App nickname: `Push Notification App`
   - Download `google-services.json`

3. **Place Configuration File**:
   ```bash
   # Place the downloaded file in:
   android/app/google-services.json
   ```

4. **Enable Cloud Messaging**:
   - In Firebase Console, go to "Cloud Messaging"
   - Service should be automatically enabled

### Step 3: Android Setup

1. **Build the Android App**:
   ```bash
   cd android
   ./gradlew clean
   cd ..
   npx react-native run-android
   ```

2. **Grant Permissions**:
   - Allow notification permissions when prompted
   - Disable battery optimization for the app (recommended)

## üîß Configuration

### Android Permissions

The app automatically requests these permissions:
- `POST_NOTIFICATIONS` - For showing notifications (Android 13+)
- `WAKE_LOCK` - To wake device for notifications
- `VIBRATE` - For notification vibration
- `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` - For background notification handling
- `USE_FULL_SCREEN_INTENT` - For call-like notifications

### Battery Optimization

For reliable notifications when the app is closed:
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Push Notification App
2. Battery ‚Üí Battery optimization
3. Select "Don't optimize" for this app

## üì± Usage

### Testing Notifications

1. **Launch the App**:
   - The home screen displays your FCM token
   - Check notification settings status

2. **Send Test Notifications**:
   - Use the "Send Test Message" button for regular notifications
   - Use the "Send Test Call" button for call-style notifications

3. **Firebase Console Testing**:
   - Go to Firebase Console ‚Üí Cloud Messaging
   - Click "Send your first message"
   - Use your FCM token as the target

### Testing Different App States

1. **Foreground**: App is open and visible
   - Notifications appear as in-app alerts
   - Call notifications show the call screen

2. **Background**: App is minimized
   - System notifications appear in notification tray
   - Tapping opens the app to relevant screen

3. **Killed**: App is force-closed
   - Notifications still appear via foreground service
   - Tapping launches the app with deep linking

## üé• Demo Video

**Note**: The demonstration video for this project was lost and is not currently available. Please evaluate this project based on the GitHub repository code, documentation, and technical implementation provided. The application is fully functional and all features can be verified through the codebase and by following the setup instructions above.

If a demonstration video is specifically required for evaluation purposes, I can record a new one upon request.

## üß™ Testing with Firebase Console

### Message Notification
```json
{
  "to": "YOUR_FCM_TOKEN",
  "notification": {
    "title": "Test Message",
    "body": "This is a test message notification"
  },
  "data": {
    "type": "message"
  }
}
```

### Call Notification
```json
{
  "to": "YOUR_FCM_TOKEN",
  "priority": "high",
  "data": {
    "type": "call",
    "caller_name": "John Doe",
    "caller_id": "1234567890",
    "call_id": "call_123456"
  },
  "notification": {
    "title": "Incoming Call",
    "body": "John Doe is calling..."
  }
}
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Native Android Components

- **FCMService**: Handles Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **CallNotificationActivity**: Full-screen call interface
- **CallForegroundService**: Background service for Android 15
- **NotificationModule**: React Native bridge module
- **NotificationActionReceiver**: Handles notification actions

### React Native Components

- **NotificationService**: Main service for notification handling
- **AppNavigator**: Navigation with deep linking support
- **HomeScreen**: Main interface with testing controls
- **CallScreen**: Call interface matching native activity
- **SettingsScreen**: Configuration and permissions management

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **FCM token not generating**:
   - Ensure `google-services.json` is in the correct location
   - Check Firebase project configuration

2. **Notifications not appearing when app is killed**:
   - Disable battery optimization for the app
   - Verify foreground service permissions

3. **Build errors**:
   ```bash
   cd android && ./gradlew clean && cd .. && npx react-native run-android
   ```

## üìö API Reference

### Key Methods

```javascript
// Initialize the service
await NotificationService.initialize();

// Get FCM token
const token = await NotificationService.getFCMToken();

// Send test notification
await NotificationService.sendTestNotification({
  type: 'call',
  caller_name: 'John Doe'
});
```

### Event Listeners

```javascript
// Listen for call actions
NotificationService.on('callAction', (action) => {
  console.log('Call action:', action.action); // 'accept' or 'decline'
});
```
